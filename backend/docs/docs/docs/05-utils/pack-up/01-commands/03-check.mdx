## Usage

```bash
$ yarn pack-up check
```

Checks your current package to ensure it's interoperable in the real world. In short, validates the files
in your dist have been produced as we expect & then `esbuild` can actually build, using your exported code.

## API

### Usage

```ts
import { check } from '@strapi/pack-up';

check();
```

## Typescript

```ts
interface CheckOptions {
  cwd?: string;
  debug?: boolean;
  silent?: boolean;
}

type Check = (options?: CheckOptions) => Promise<void>;
```
